# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project calculates interest for a savings account over a given number of years. It uses a user given initial investment amount, monthly deposit amount, the annual interest percentage, and the number of years to calculate for. With the given information the program will then display two charts. One without taking in account for the monthly deposit and one that does include monthly deposits. The program is to demonstrate the importance of savings and how compound interest can build quickly.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did well at keeping my code tidy and making sure comments are included to easily understand each part of the program. I also did well when making sure the calculations are correct.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
An imporvement I could make is to improve the user interface. The user interface could be improved by tidying and maybe simplifing the user inputs so it's easier for the user to read and follow.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Writing the functions and connecting the files to the main.cpp were the biggest challenges I found. Taking my time and thinking about what functions need to be called as well as how and when helped when working on the project. The textbook was an additional resource that I used to refresh myself on syntax and how to properly connect the files.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The project is a basic object oriented programming project, by having the skills to write and work with a simple project like this will help me in the future to work on more complex projects.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Keeping the code tidy and adding comments made my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
